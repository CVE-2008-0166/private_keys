# private_keys
[Debian weak keys](https://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys), DER-encoded in the following formats:
- PKCS#1 [RSAPrivateKey](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8017#appendix-A.1.2), with public exponent 65537.
- SEC1 [ECPrivateKey](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5915#section-3).

These private keys were generated using the tools in the [key_generator](https://github.com/CVE-2008-0166/key_generator) repository. Using these private keys, CAs can implement their own Debian weak key checks without having to be tied to the RSA-only blocklist format made available by Debian when the CVE-2008-0166 vulnerability was first disclosed.

*NOTE:* When designing Debian weak key checks, it is important for CAs to be aware that all RSA public exponents are equally vulnerable when used with an RSA modulus generated by a vulnerable Debian system.

CAs could consider using the pregenerated blocklists in the [dwk_blocklists](https://github.com/CVE-2008-0166/dwk_blocklists) repository, which list the SHA-256 hashes of the RSA moduli and EC X-coordinates of the private keys in this repository.
